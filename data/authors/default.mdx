I am Ioannis (John) Voyatzis and I live in Athens, Greece.

Currently, I am Lead Android Engineer at Accenture and specifically I am working as a consultant in a Bank. The responsibilities of my role include not only the development and the improvement of the Bank’s products, but leading a team of Android developers as well as training and mentoring them. Towards this end, I regularly find myself reading Software Engineering stuff and making the appropriate research and development so as to enhance my knowledge.

Previously, I was a Senior Android Developer at Viva. During my time there, I focused on developing new features for the company’s main product, a payment app. Apart from that, I also introduced new technologies and guidelines both on the old and the new version of the app. Those guidelines were relative to making the code testable and being able to write unit tests, using certain principles such as Dependency Inversion, Open/Closed Principle. I also took hands on several interesting r&d tasks such as the capability to utilize both GSM and Wifi networks simultaneously in order to switch from the stable (WIFI) network to GSM in case the first got a failure. Teaching and training the rest of the team for all these was also a part of my role.

Prior joining Viva, I was a Software Engineer at Satways, a small company which creates Command & Control solutions for Security & Public Safety applications. My role was focused on Android Platform and Web Services. Specifically, I lead the development of company’s Android solutions Engage IMS/CAD and EU-funded projects, by creating a core app used as a template. Additionally, I designed & developed Rest APIs, did work for Enterprise tasks, mainly in the JAVA EE framework. Furthermore, I contributed to by writing proposals and finally I did presentations & trainings to clients.

I have also worked, for a short time, in academia, as a Research Assistant at Distributed Computer Systems Lab DCS of FORTH-ICS. My research focused on Android Platform Security and included research on the techniques that a malware can employ to evade dynamic analysis in emulated Android Enviroments and the discovery of malicious Android Applications in Alternative Markets.

I hold a B.Sc in Computer Science from Computer Science Department of University of Crete. For more details, you can take a look on my LinkedIn profile.

I my spare time, I enjoy listening to music, reading about bands and buying vinyls as well. Coding is a hobby for me and occasionally I am doing it for some of my personal projects on my Github profile as well as enriching my knowledge on Mobile Apps Development and Software Engineering in general. Also, I like outdoor running and I have participated in 10km & half marathons. My goal is to run the original marathon in the near future.

Hi there, I'm John!

I specialize in Android Mobile Development with extensive experience across industries such as banking, fintech, and public safety. In recent years, my focus has been on developing applications for financial services and payment solutions, ensuring security and scalability.

Currently working at Accenture as a Lead Android Engineer for a Hellenic Systemic Bank, leading a team of 15+ developers. Responsible for designing the appâ€™s architecture, ensuring scalability and maintainability, driving feature development, providing release support, and mentoring the team.

In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music, reading about bands and buying vinyls as well
